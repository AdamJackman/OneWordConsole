* This application is built to allow users to in essence safely use the same simple password for all sites.
* The application is not limited to this and will turn any password given to an extremely strong unique password.
* Passwords are unique to both person and site.
* No passwords are ever saved by the program

<b>oneWord</b> works by encrypting the given password using a randomized salt that is saved in a database unique to
the creator and the site it was created for. This allows consistency and safety for the user.
